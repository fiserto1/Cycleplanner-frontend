#Bicycle Route Planner

Bicycle Route Planner is capable of computing routes for cyclists from an origin to a destination. It solves the multi-criteria bicycle routing problem based on a formal model expressive enough to represent transport network features and cyclists' preferences grounded in the studies of [real-world bicycle route choice behaviour](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0965856412001164). Our solution employs the [heuristic-enabled multi-criteria label-setting algorithm](http://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/volltexte/2015/5458/pdf/9.pdf) together with a combination of heuristic speedups enabling fast query runtimes. We optimise for three criteria: travel time, cycling stress, and physical effort.

Bicycle Route Planner is developed by [the Agent-based Computing for Intelligent Transport Systems group](http://transport.felk.cvut.cz/), [Faculty of Electrical Engineering](http://www.fel.cvut.cz/en/), [Czech Technical University in Prague](https://www.cvut.cz/en).

As one of the data sources for routing, Bicycle Route Planner uses [OpenStreetMap maps](http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright), a collaborative project to create a free editable map of the world based on the [Open Database License](http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/).
